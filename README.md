# Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow for Image Processing and Computer Vision

This repository contains an implementation of Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow, a method for estimating motion between frames in a video sequence, crucial for various computer vision applications.

## Features
- Efficient motion estimation between consecutive frames
- Suitable for tracking small motion in video sequences

## Applications
- Object Tracking: Follow objects' movements across frames.
- Motion Analysis: Analyze the dynamics of moving objects.
- Video Stabilization: Compensate for camera motion to stabilize videos.
- Optical Flow-based Segmentation: Use motion information for scene segmentation.

## Acknowledgments
This implementation was developed as part of a computer vision course taught at the Indian Statistical Institute by Professor Pradipta Maji, Professor at the Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, located at 203 B. T. Road, Kolkata 700108, India, from August 2022 to December 2022.
